1. Get all packages setup
- clone adam's vive_tracker_loc and NU-MSR's overhead_mobile_tracker  
- make sure you clone jarvis-edits branch for both pkgs. and follow ther readme on how to run
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911109/how-to-clone-a-specific-git-branch >> how to clone specific branch
2. Run the calibration file to get odom_frame_broadcaster.launch first
- roslaunch overhead_mobile_tracker calibrate_system.launch
    - press c, wait calmly till the calibration finish status is shown, and press w after finish calibrating to save the launch file
- roslaunch overhead_mobile_tracker vive_track.launch 
    - this will start tracking the vive tracker
- rostopic echo /tracker_pose_filter
    - put the center on the black dot at the edge of blue tape on the floor. You shoud get roughly 1 x 1m of x-y plane by placing the center of the tracker on each different dot.
    - If not, recalibrate again.
3. Run the robot like usual but don't forget
    - rosbag record -O bag/vive_odom_bag_(round number).bag /tracker_pose_filter /odom
    - the latest round is 10.
4. To plot
    - change the name of the file path to be the desired bag
    - run that test_odom.py in ~/Boeing/ros_ws/src/boeing_mobile dir. (It's about how I get the string of the directory, It should be better but I just ditched that problem.)
